# Sync-It
A friendly Windows only systray app to sync two folders as and when required.

If you use this program, it's at your own risk.

pip3 install dirsync

pip3 install infi.systray

pip3 install Pillow

sync-it.ico in same dir as this code is run from.
If not found the default system icon will be used.
